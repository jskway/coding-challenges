# Reverse a String In-Place

## Problem

Write a function that takes a list of characters and reverses the letters in
place.

**Why a list of characters instead of a string?**

The goal of this question is to practice manipulating strings _in place_. Since
we're modifying the input, we need a mutable type like a list, instead of
Python 3.6's _immutable_ strings

## Example

```python
# Input:
reverse_chars(['s', 't', 'a', 'r', 't'])

# Output:
['t', 'r', 'a', 't', 's']
```
