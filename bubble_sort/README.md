# Bubble Sort

**Bubble sort** is a sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list,
compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they're in the wrong order.

## Algorithm

1. Loop through the array

   - Compare each element to its right neighbor
   - If the element is greater than its neighbor, swap them

2. If no swaps were made, stop. Else, go back to the beginning of the list and
   repeat

Bubble sort has a time complexity of **O(n^2)** and space complexity of **O(1)**.
