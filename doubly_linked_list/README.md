# Doubly Linked Lists

A **linked list** organized items sequentially, with each item storing a pointer
to the next one.

In a basic linked list, each item stores a pointer to the next element.

In a **doubly linked list**, items have pointers to the next _and the previous_
nodes. Doubly linked lists allow us to traverse our list backwards.

An item in a linked list is called a **node**. The first node is called the
**head**. The last node is called the **tail**.

### Strengths

- **Fast operators on the ends**. Adding elements at either the head or tail of
  a linked list is _O(1)_. Removing the first element is also _O(1)_.
- **Flexible size**. There's no need to specify a fixed number of items to
  store when creating a linked list. You can keep adding items as long as you
  have memory.

### Weaknesses

- **Costly lookups, inserts and deletes.** To access, insert or modify an item
  in a linked list, you have to take _O(n)_ time to traverse from the head of
  the list to the _nth_ item.

| ------------- | ---------- |
| **_space_**   | _O(n)_     |
| **_prepend_** | _O(1)_     |
| **_append_**  | _O(1)_     |
| **_lookup_**  | _O(n)_     |
| **_insert_**  | _O(n)_     |
| **_delete_**  | _O(n)_     |
