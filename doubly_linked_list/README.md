# Doubly Linked Lists

- The `DoublyLinkedList` class itself should have the methods: `add_to_head`, `add_to_tail`, `remove_from_head`, `remove_from_tail`, `move_to_front`, `move_to_end`, `delete`, and `get_max`.
  - `add_to_head` replaces the head of the list with a new value that is passed in.
  - `add_to_tail` replaces the tail of the list with a new value that is passed in.
  - `remove_from_head` removes the head node and returns the value stored in it.
  - `remove_from_tail` removes the tail node and returns the value stored in it.
  - `move_to_front` takes a reference to a node in the list and moves it to the front of the list, shifting all other list nodes down.
  - `move_to_end` takes a reference to a node in the list and moves it to the end of the list, shifting all other list nodes up.
  - `delete` takes a reference to a node in the list and removes it from the list. The deleted node's `previous` and `next` pointers should point to each afterwards.
  - `get_max` returns the maximum value in the list.
- The `head` property is a reference to the first node and the `tail` property is a reference to the last node.
